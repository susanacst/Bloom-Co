# 🌷 Bloom-Co — Frontend Practice for a Flower Shop

**Bloom-Co** is a fictional flower shop brand I created to practice web interface design and frontend development for online stores.  
This project is a minimal **empty shell** — it features a basic layout and initial structure, and it's meant to evolve as I improve my frontend skills. 💻🌸
